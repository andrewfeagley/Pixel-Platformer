# Pixel-Platformer
A 2D Smash Bros. Clone based on the Pixel Platformer Engine

This is an attempt to make a simple fighting game in Unity. I want the game to be a full featured platform fighter. With knockback, hitlag, blast-zones and more.

This game uses The Pixel Platform Engine, art from [WoostarPixel](https://twitter.com/WoostarsPixels) and [dogchicken](https://opengameart.org/users/dogchicken), and a statemachine made by [MonsterLove](https://github.com/thefuntastic/Unity3d-Finite-State-Machine).

The minimum goals are:

* Have at least two playable characters that players can choose from
* Have at least two stages that players can choose from
* Have two colors for each character
* Couch Co-op

The stretch goals are:

* Online Multiplayer
* Multi-Controller support
* More than four characters
* More than four stages
